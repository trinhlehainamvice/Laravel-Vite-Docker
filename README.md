### Problems
- build webapp Docker Image requires `pnpm-lock.json` file, so need to install webapp project first in host machine with `pnpm install` 
- clean volumes when down Docker Project. `docker compose down --volumes`
- find better for front-end engineers can use command more productively. `pnpm dev` `pnpm build` `pnpm preview`
